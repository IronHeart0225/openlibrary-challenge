# Challenge project to search books using openlibrary

## Project requirements

- Create a website with Typescript, React and a UI library of your choice.
- Call openlibrary api with the book name the user entered
https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=book+name+here
- Build it with auto-search (eg. no search button), but only call the API a reasonable amount of times (eg. not every time the user clicks a keyboard button).
- Create a typescript type for the results object. https://quicktype.io/typescript.
- Add a button to toggle sorting the books by relevance (which is how openlibrary returns the books) or by the year the book was first published.

## Implemented Features
- technologies: React JS, Typescript, SCSS
- Search engine has a "debounce of about 500ms"
